# QuickJobs

Cross-platform simple job search tool that aggregates jobs from major job sites all at once (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Google, etc.) and lets you save them to your to-do list. Each job will have a link to the application.

You can also mark certain jobs as completed so that they won't appear in your search results anymore.
